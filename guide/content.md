# Places of interest

1. Community Center - The place where some indoor games like **badminton** are played. **Yoga** is also done here.

3. Restaurant - The Veg Crispy Rolls are the **best**
4. Health Center - Apparently the _place_ to get medicines
5. Old Library - No books are left here, only their **ghosts**
6. CAF - **Nobody** knows what happens here
7. LHC - You _know_ what this is.
8. Admin - Important people like the security guard who **protects** the admin building sit here.
9. Library - There is good AC here. Nothing else of any real interest
10. AB 1 and 2 - The scientific grounds of IISER Mohali. There's a _Quantum Computer_ here. Eventually there will be one hopefully.
